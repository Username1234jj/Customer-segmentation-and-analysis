This project applies **machine learning and data analysis** techniques to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior, demographics, or spending patterns. Customer segmentation helps businesses understand their audience better and make data-driven marketing or product decisions.

## 🧠 Overview

Customer segmentation is a key part of business analytics and marketing strategy. In this project, unsupervised learning (mainly **K-Means clustering**) is used to identify distinct groups of customers from the dataset.

The project workflow includes:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization  
- Feature scaling and dimensionality reduction (if required)  
- Applying clustering algorithms such as **K-Means** or **Hierarchical Clustering**  
- Interpreting and visualizing customer segments  

---

## ✨ Features

- Clean and preprocess raw customer data  
- Analyze and visualize spending and behavioral patterns  
- Automatically group customers with similar traits  
- Visualize clusters using 2D/3D plots  
- Generate actionable insights for business decision-making  

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**  
- **Pandas** – data manipulation  
- **NumPy** – numerical computations  
- **Matplotlib** / **Seaborn** – data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – clustering algorithms, scaling, and PCA  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – interactive exploration  

---

## 📊 Dataset

You can use any customer dataset such as:
- **Mall Customer Segmentation Data** from Kaggle  
- Or any dataset containing fields like:  
  - `CustomerID`  
  - `Age`  
  - `Gender`  
  - `Annual Income`  
  - `Spending Score`  

Make sure your data is in CSV format and stored in the `data/` folder.

Example:  
```
data/
└── Mall_Customers.csv
```

## ⚙️ Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Username1234jj/Customer-segmentation-and-analysis.git
   cd Customer-segmentation-and-analysis
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Place your dataset (`Mall_Customers.csv`) in the `data/` folder.

4. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook customer_segmentation.ipynb
   ```

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Load and explore the dataset.  
2. Handle missing or inconsistent data.  
3. Perform **EDA** to understand variable distributions and relationships.  
4. Apply **feature scaling** (StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler).  
5. Use **K-Means clustering** to segment customers.  
6. Determine the optimal number of clusters using the **Elbow Method** or **Silhouette Score**.  
7. Visualize results using scatter plots or PCA.  
8. Interpret each segment (e.g., high spenders, budget customers, young professionals).

## 🧾 Example Output

```
Number of clusters chosen: 5
Cluster Summary:
1 - Young, high spenders
2 - Older, low spenders
3 - Middle-aged, moderate income and spending
...
```

Visuals include:
- Pair plots of customer groups  
- Cluster distribution charts  
- Spending vs. income visualizations

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Integrate **Hierarchical Clustering** or **DBSCAN**  
- Automate insight generation from clusters  
- Build a **dashboard** (Streamlit/Plotly Dash) for interactive analysis  
- Connect to a **live business database** for real-time segmentation
